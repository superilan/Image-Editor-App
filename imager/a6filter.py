Image processing methods for the imager application.

This module provides all of the image processing operations that are called 
whenever you press a button. Some of these are provided for you and others you
are expected to write on your own.

Note that this class is a subclass of Editor. This allows you to make use
of the undo functionality. You do not have to do anything special to take 
advantage of this.  Just make sure you use getCurrent() to access the most 
recent version of the image.

    A class that contains a collection of image processing methods
    
    This class is a subclass of a6editor. That means it inherits all of the 
    methods and attributes of that class too. We do that (1) to put all of the 
    image processing methods in one easy to read place and (2) because we might 
    want to change how we implement the undo functionality later.
    
    This class is broken into three parts (1) implemented non-hidden methods, 
    (2) non-implemented non-hidden methods and (3) hidden methods. The 
    non-hidden methods each correspond to a button press in the main 
    application.  The hidden methods are all helper functions.
    
    Each one of the non-hidden functions should edit the most recent image 
    in the edit history (which is inherited from Editor).
